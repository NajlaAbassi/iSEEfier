Description: 
    iSEEfier provides a set of functionality to quickly and intuitively create, 
    inspect, and combine initial configuration objects. 
    These can be conveniently passed in a straightforward manner to the function
    call to launch iSEE() with the specified configuration. 
    This package currently works seamlessly with the sets of panels provided by 
    the iSEE and iSEEu packages, but can be extended to accommodate the usage of
    any custom panel (e.g. from iSEEde, iSEEpathways, or any panel developed 
    independently by the user).
