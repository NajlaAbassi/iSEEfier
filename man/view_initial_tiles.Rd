\title{View an initial object as a set of tiles}
\usage{
view_initial_tiles(initial)
}
\arguments{
\item{initial}{An \code{initial} list object, in the format that is required to
be passed as a parameter in the call to \code{\link[iSEE:iSEE]{iSEE::iSEE()}}.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object, representing a schematic view for the \code{initial}
object.
}
\description{
Previews the layout of the \code{initial} configuration object in a graphical form.
}
\details{
Tiles are used to represent the panel types, and reflect the values of their
width.
This can be a compact visualization to obtain an overview for the configuration,
without the need of fully launching the app and loading the content of all
panels

This function is particularly useful with mid-to-large \code{initial} objects, as
they can be quickly generated in a programmatic manner via the \code{iSEEinit()}
provided in this package.
