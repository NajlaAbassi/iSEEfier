#' iSEEfier: a very convenient way to fire up your iSEE instance
#'
#' iSEEfier provides a set of functionality to quickly create, inspect, and
#' combine `initial` configuration objects.
#' These can be conveniently passed to the function call to launch `iSEE()`
#' in this manner.
#' This currently works with the sets of panels provided by the `iSEE` and `iSEEu`
#' packages, but can be extended to accommodate the usage of any custom panel
#' (e.g. from `iSEEde`, `iSEEpathways`, or any panel developed independently by the
#' user).
